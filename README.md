Reflection: 
I found making something from nothing was very cool, and I liked the way we drew what we were creating first. I found that making the small car and the sun were very challenging. I had to look up a video at one point, just because I needed help and forgot about the code in class. I learned a lot about coding on my own while also learning a little bit from the videos. I am starting to get comfortable with coding for now.
